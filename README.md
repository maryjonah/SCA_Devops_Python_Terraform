# SCA_Devops_Python_Terraform
This project is a build up on my first SCA Devops Mentorship Project [here](https://github.com/maryjonah/SCA_Devops_Python_Project)
The task is to automate the entire process using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

Tech Stack
- Flask: used for logic of project .i.e. counting the number of visits.
- Terraform
- GitHub Actions: to automate the build, test, and deployment pipelines.
